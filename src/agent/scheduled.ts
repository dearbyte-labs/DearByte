// What DearByte does on its own: a morning brief once a day, and caution
// alerts when your body and your day don't match. The rules in
// health/caution.ts decide whether to speak; the agent writes the words.
//
// Limits, all in code: no messages in quiet hours (23:00–07:00), at most
// MAX_CAUTIONS_PER_DAY cautions, each rule at most once a day, and one brief a
// day. Every message is stored in agent_alerts before it is sent. When the
// weekly spending cap stops the model, a fixed notice says so, once a day.
