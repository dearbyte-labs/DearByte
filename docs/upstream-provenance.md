### How it is used

Used as design reference only. No upstream files are vendored and no text is copied verbatim. The skill's adviser workflow (intake questionnaire, MBTI and 0–100 scoring, strategy reports, multi-option advice) is intentionally **not** used.

The following files informed the conversational rules in `prompts/persona.zh-CN.md` and the original examples in `prompts/dialogue-examples.zh-CN.json`:

| Upstream file | Ideas adapted |
|---|---|
| `references/practical/巧妙接话技巧：让沟通更流畅的实用指南.md` | Answer the emotion, not just the literal words; build on keywords; avoid replies that end the conversation |
| `references/practical/场景感、松弛感与社交校准：从接话到关系推进.md` | The 接/放/给/抛 turn structure; the anti-"interview" rule; green/yellow/red calibration; what is and isn't fair game for teasing |
| `references/practical/为他人提供情绪价值：温暖且有效的回应指南.md` | Emotion before content; no lecturing or dismissing; specific praise; remembering small things |
| `references/practical/废话文学回复指南：轻松应对各类场景.md` | Light banter in low-stakes moments, never for important topics |
| `references/practical/化解尴尬：轻松救场的实用指南.md` | Self-deprecation when wrong; no triple apologies |
| `references/knowledge/17-中国法律安全与危机转介.md` | What counts as a crisis signal; directing people to 110/120 in `prompts/safety.zh-CN.md` |

### Deliberate deviations

The upstream guides often suggest "share a similar experience of your own" (我上次也……). The companion is an AI (it says so when sincerely asked), so the persona replaces this with opinions, observations from the conversation, and remembered history. It never invents human experiences.

If upstream text is ever vendored into `references/goutoujunshi/`, include the upstream `LICENSE` file alongside it.

### How it is used

Design reference only. No files are vendored.

- **Closely adapted:** the 「说人话」 section of `prompts/persona.zh-CN.md` follows `buildHumanTonePrompt()` in `packages/core/src/llm/PromptBuilder.ts` (no lists, no 客服腔, no formal linking words, advice in your own voice).
- **Re-implemented from the idea:**
  - `recentPhrases()` in `src/companion/prompt.ts` follows `llm/AntiRepeat.ts`: list 小拜's recent phrases at the end of the prompt.
  - `src/companion/tone.ts` follows the metrics in `work/agnes_ai_tone_probe.mts`.
  - The jittered typing pauses in `src/channels/reply-loop.ts` follow the idea of `TypingSimulator.ts`.

## ex-skill (前任.skill)

- Source: https://github.com/perkfly/ex-skill (MIT, Copyright (c) 2026 perkfly), revision `c5ece53`
- Reviewed, not used in code or prompts. Its method (write persona rules as concrete behaviour, use real example lines, measure style from real chat logs) shaped how the examples were rewritten.
