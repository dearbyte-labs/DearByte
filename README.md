DearByte is a personal agent you run yourself. It:

- **Knows you.** Your Apple Watch health data, your calendar, and what you've asked it to remember.
- **Watches for you.** When your body and your schedule don't match, it says so ("you slept 5 hours and have leg day at 7; go light"). It also tells you about big news from the companies you follow within minutes, not weeks.
- **Spends for you, within limits.** It can propose buying a service. Code enforces the caps, and nothing is paid until you approve.

It's a friend and a coach, not an assistant reading a script, and never a romantic partner. It's not a doctor either: it talks about sleep, energy and pacing, and points you to a real one for anything medical.

## Why DearByte

Most AI assistants run on someone else's servers, and none of them know how you slept. DearByte is built around four choices:

- **Yours.** Self-hosted and open source. Your memory and logs live in a folder on your machine, and your health data goes through a Worker in your own Cloudflare account.
- **Body-aware.** Suggestions account for your sleep, recovery and schedule, measured against *your* normal, not a generic target.
- **Careful with money.** The agent can only propose purchases. Caps and allowlists are enforced in code, you approve every payment, and every payment gets a receipt.
- **Honest about cost.** Every model call is logged with its price, a weekly cap stops spending, and cheap models do the bulk work while a strong model makes the calls that matter.

## Status

DearByte is early and built in the open. All of Phase 1 is on `master`, with 289 offline tests. What works today and what's coming:

| Part | Status |
| --- | --- |
| Agent core: tool loop, validated tools, Claude or DeepSeek as "brain" and "worker" tiers | **Works**, tested offline and with live DeepSeek runs |
| Spending controls: per-run and weekly caps, a usage log of every model call | **Works** |
| Persona packs: English DearByte, the opt-in Chinese Xiaobai, and any the community adds ([how](docs/personas.md)) | **Works**, each pack checked in CI |
| Chat companion in the terminal and in WeChat (Xiaobai, Chinese) with memory and proactive check-ins | **Works**, see [the companion](#the-chinese-companion-xiaobai) |
| Apple Watch and Apple Health data, through [dearbyte-bridge](https://github.com/dearbyte-labs/dearbyte-bridge) | **Works** with the bridge's test data; a live test with a real iPhone is next |
| Calendar awareness: your Apple Calendar events (read on the Mac, which iCloud keeps in sync with your iPhone), in the brief and in caution alerts | **Works** on macOS, tested live on a real calendar |
| Caution alerts and a morning brief, judged against your own normal sleep, resting heart rate and HRV, and what's on your calendar today | **Works** |
| Telegram for alerts, a 👍/👎 on every alert, and Approve/Reject buttons | **Works** in tests; a live test with a real bot is next |
| Company watchlist: official newsroom feeds and SEC filings, screened against what you care about | **Works**, tested live on real feeds |
| FIRE plan: your road to financial independence (4% rule and die-with-zero numbers, earliest retirement age, net worth by age) from `finance.json`, with what-ifs | **Works**; the numbers come from code, the model only explains them |
| Testnet wallet: the agent proposes a paid service, you approve, it pays within a cap, and you get a receipt | **Works** with x402 on Base Sepolia, tested live against the example seller in dev mode; an on-chain payment needs test USDC from the faucet |

## Roadmap

**Phase 1: the first demo** (target: 2026-09-28)
- [x] Agent core: tool loop, Claude/DeepSeek tiers, spending caps, usage log, English persona
- [x] Apple Watch and Apple Health data through [dearbyte-bridge](https://github.com/dearbyte-labs/dearbyte-bridge), and `npm run agent`
- [x] Daily health snapshots, so DearByte learns your normal sleep, resting heart rate and HRV
- [x] Caution alerts and a morning brief, with quiet hours and a daily limit (calendar comes in Phase 2)
- [x] Telegram for alerts, and Approve/Reject buttons
- [x] Company watchlist: official newsroom feeds and SEC filings, with relevance filtered against what you care about
- [x] Testnet wallet demo: the agent proposes a paid service, you approve, it pays in test USDC within a cap, and you get a receipt

**Phase 2: daily use, measured**
- Two weeks of real use with feedback on every alert; measure precision, missed events, delay and cost per month
- Calendar awareness on the Mac (done early, see Status); an English app UI and more news sources
- Money: MindGo, the budgeting app, connected through a read-only MCP endpoint, so the FIRE plan uses your real spending and saving, and DearByte speaks up when spending runs ahead of the term's pace or a goal falls behind (built early: needs MindGo's `/mcp` deployed)
- Approving purchases from the Apple Watch (needs a paid Apple Developer account)

**Later**
- A hosted DearByte for people who don't want to run it themselves
- A marketplace where solo developers and small companies sell useful services to agents, with DearByte as the first buyer. The agent, the bridge and the seller SDK stay open source.

## Quick start

Requires **Node.js 26+** (with nvm, run `nvm use` in the repo).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dearbyte-labs/DearByte.git
cd DearByte
npm install
npm test
```

Create `.env` in the project root. It's ignored by Git:

```dotenv
DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=your_key
```

Run the agent once on sample data. This costs about $0.001:

```bash
npm run agent:smoke
npm run agent:usage
```

`agent:smoke` asks "How did I sleep, and should I still do leg day tonight?" against two sample tools and prints each step, the tool calls and the answer. `agent:usage` shows what that cost.

Then use the agent itself (`npm run agent` lists every command):

```bash
npm run agent -- status     # which models, tools and limits are active
npm run agent -- chat       # talk to it; tools appear as you set them up
npm run agent -- watch      # always on: morning brief, caution alerts, news
npm run agent -- wechat     # talk to it in WeChat, in Mandarin (see the companion section for setup)
npm run agent -- imessage -m   # talk to it in iMessage: -m Mandarin, -e English (see below)
```

To see all of it at once, `npm run demo` runs the three parts in order: a morning brief, a news check and an approved purchase. It uses your real setup where you have one, and sample data where you don't.

The [agent guide](docs/agent-guide.md) walks through setting up health, Telegram, the watchlist and the wallet in order, and has a checklist for testing each one live.

## Configuration

All settings go in `.env`.

| Setting | Default | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` | — | Key for DeepSeek, the default model for both tiers |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | — | Key for Claude; needed when a tier uses `anthropic:` |
| `DEARBYTE_BRAIN` | `deepseek:deepseek-flash` | The model for judgment calls: caution alerts, news analysis, anything about money. For demos: `anthropic:claude-opus-5-5` |
| `DEARBYTE_BRAIN_EFFORT` | the model's default | `low` to `max`; set `high` for Claude Opus 5.5 |
| `DEARBYTE_WORKER` | `deepseek:deepseek-flash` | The model for high-volume, easy-to-check work: filtering, summaries |
| `DEARBYTE_PERSONA` | `default` | A persona pack in `personas/`: `default` (English DearByte), `xiaobai` (Chinese), or any other in [the index](personas/INDEX.md) |
| `DEARBYTE_WEEKLY_CAP` | `5` | USD the agent may spend on model calls in any 7 days; `0` turns the cap off |
| `HEALTH_MCP_URL` | — | Your dearbyte-bridge MCP address. It contains a secret, so treat it like a password |
| `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` | — | Your bot's token from @BotFather. Secret: whoever has it controls the bot |
| `SEC_CONTACT_EMAIL` | — | SEC asks automated clients for a contact email; without it the watchlist reads newsrooms only |
| `DEARBYTE_WATCHLIST` | `watchlist.json` | Where your watchlist is |
| `DEARBYTE_FINANCE` | `finance.json` | Where your FIRE profile is (copy `finance.example.json`) |
| `MINDGO_MCP_URL` | — | MindGo's read-only MCP endpoint, e.g. `https://<your-mindgo-api>/mcp` |
| `MINDGO_TOKEN` | — | A MindGo access token (`mgo_…`, from `npm run access-token` in MindGo). Secret, but read-only and revocable |
| `DEARBYTE_CALENDAR` | on (macOS) | `off` stops DearByte reading your calendar. `npm run agent -- calendar` asks macOS for access and lists the next 48 hours |
| `DEARBYTE_WALLET_KEY` | — | The testnet wallet's key; `npm run agent -- wallet new` creates it and writes it here |
| `DEARBYTE_SELLERS` | — | Comma-separated seller addresses the wallet may buy from, like `http://127.0.0.1:4021` |
| `DEARBYTE_MAX_PURCHASE` | `0.25` | USD limit per purchase |
| `DEARBYTE_MAX_DAY` | `1` | USD limit per day |
| `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` | — | Your chat with the bot; `npm run agent -- telegram` finds it. Only this chat can use the buttons |
| `DEARBYTE_WECHAT_PERSONA` | `xiaobai` | The persona the agent uses in Mandarin: WeChat, and iMessage with `-m` |
| `DEARBYTE_IMESSAGE_TO` | none | The one person the agent answers in iMessage: a phone number or Apple ID email (or pass `--to`) |

A model without a known price is refused, so the spending caps always work.

### Company watchlist

Copy `watchlist.example.json` to `watchlist.json` (ignored by Git) and edit it. `interests` says, in your words, what's worth a message; each company has its newsroom feeds and, optionally, its SEC number (`cik`).

```bash
npm run agent -- news    # check once; `watch` checks every hour
```

Only official sources are read: each company's newsroom feed and its SEC filings (8-K, 10-Q, 10-K and similar; not insider trades). Each check:
1. Stores what's new, deduped by source id. Anything already 2 days old when first seen is recorded but never screened.
2. The worker model screens new items against your `interests` and records a verdict and a reason for each, through a validated tool call.
3. The brain writes one short message about what passed. The links are appended by code from the stored items, not written by the model.

News follows the same quiet hours as health, with at most 3 news messages a day. The agent can also answer "anything new on Meta?" from what was collected (`get_company_news`).

### Testnet wallet

DearByte can buy things for you from sellers you approve, over [x402](https://www.x402.org) (HTTP 402 "Payment Required", paid in USDC). Phase 1 is **testnet only**: Base Sepolia and test USDC, never real money.

```bash
npm run agent -- wallet new          # creates a key, writes it to .env, prints the address
# get free test USDC at https://faucet.circle.com (network: Base Sepolia)
npm run seller -- --dev              # an example seller on http://127.0.0.1:4021
DEARBYTE_SELLERS=http://127.0.0.1:4021 npm run agent -- chat
```

1. **You ask, it proposes.** For example: "I slept 5 hours; get me the recovery plan at http://127.0.0.1:4021/recovery-plan." The model can only call `propose_purchase`. Code then:
   - asks the seller its price (the 402 answer);
   - checks the seller allowlist and the per-purchase and daily caps;
   - sends you an approval request.
2. **You approve** with the button in Telegram, `/approve N` in chat, or `npm run agent -- approve N`. You always see the request as code wrote it (price, seller, recipient first), and in the terminal you confirm with "yes". At most 3 requests wait at once, and each expires after 15 minutes.
3. **It pays, and you get a receipt.** Code asks for a fresh quote and refuses if the recipient changed or the price went up. It then reserves the amount against the daily limit, signs a transfer for exactly the approved amount (valid for at most 5 minutes), gets the resource, and keeps the receipt with its transaction link. If a signed payment goes out but no transaction comes back, the receipt says "unconfirmed" and the amount still counts toward the limit. `npm run agent -- wallet` shows the balance, limits and recent purchases.

The example seller's `--dev` mode checks the signature without touching the chain, so you can demo the whole flow before the faucet. Without `--dev` (and with `SELLER_PAY_TO` set), payments settle on Base Sepolia through the x402.org facilitator. The seller moves to its own repo as the start of the seller SDK.

### Telegram

Terminal first; Telegram is where DearByte reaches you when you're away from it. It sends briefs and alerts, each with 👍 Useful / 👎 Not useful buttons (the ratings show up in `npm run agent -- status`, so alert precision is measured, not guessed), and anything that needs your yes comes with ✅ Approve / ❌ Reject.

1. Message @BotFather in Telegram, send `/newbot`, and put the token in `.env` as `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`.
2. Send your bot any message, then run `npm run agent -- telegram`. It prints your chat id; add it as `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID`.
3. Run `npm run agent -- telegram` again. It sends a test approval; tap a button to check it works.

Button taps are handled while `npm run agent -- watch` runs. Approval requests expire after 15 minutes, each is decided once, and messages or taps from any other chat are ignored.

## How it works

```

                      │           └─ usage log + weekly cap
                      ▼

                             ├─ memory
                             ├─ company watchlist
                             ├─ FIRE plan (finance.json + MindGo)
                             └─ propose_purchase ──► your approval ──► payment code
```

- **Our own agent loop** (`src/agent/`): the model proposes tool calls, and every call is checked against a schema before it runs. Tool errors go back to the model instead of crashing the loop. No tools run after a refusal or a cut-off call, and each run stops at 8 steps or $0.50.
- **Any model, one interface:** Claude and DeepSeek both go through Anthropic's SDK (DeepSeek through its Anthropic-compatible endpoint). Claude-only features, such as adaptive thinking and refusal fallbacks, are sent only to Claude.
- **Approvals live outside the model.** The model can only propose a purchase. Payment code runs only when you approve (in Telegram or the terminal), with caps and a seller allowlist checked in code, and each approval is decided once.
- **Prompts stay cacheable:** the system prompt is identical on every request, and the current time goes into the message instead.

## Data and privacy

- **Your data stays on your machine** in the Git-ignored `data/` folder: memory, chat history, the usage log, daily health summaries, alerts and your ratings, news items, approvals and purchase receipts.
- **What leaves:** the context of each request goes to the model provider you choose (DeepSeek or Anthropic). Health data goes from your phone to *your own* Cloudflare Worker (dearbyte-bridge), and from there only to clients you give its secret MCP address to, such as DearByte. Briefs, alerts and approval requests you get in Telegram go through Telegram's servers. Your finance profile stays in `finance.json`; when you ask about it, the plan's numbers go to the model provider with the request. Your calendar is read on your Mac, titles and times only (never notes, attendees or locations); the titles DearByte uses go to the model provider with the request, like any other context. The watchlist only reads public newsroom feeds and SEC filings.
- **The wallet key** stays in `.env` and is only used to sign payments you approved; it's never sent anywhere or printed.
- **Memory is inspectable and deletable,** and every stored fact quotes your own words as evidence.
- **Health:** DearByte uses summaries (last night's sleep, your 7-day average), not raw sample history. It isn't a medical device.

## Personas

`default` is DearByte in English: warm, a little cheeky, and never a partner. It gives US crisis resources (988, 911) if anyone is in danger. `xiaobai` is an opt-in Chinese persona with the tsundere 小拜 tone and China's crisis numbers. Both share the same rules: facts only from tools, missing data reported as unknown, and plain wording for anything involving money.

Personas are packs, one folder each in `personas/` (a manifest, the persona and optional examples), and anyone can add one in a PR. A pack changes how DearByte talks, never what it may do: the rules always come after it and win, CI rejects a pack that tries to override them, and every merged pack is recorded in [personas/INDEX.md](personas/INDEX.md) with its authors and version. See [writing a persona](docs/personas.md).

## The Chinese companion: Xiaobai

DearByte started as 小拜 (Xiaobai), a Chinese chat companion with its own personality. She has controllable memory and proactive check-ins, and runs in the terminal or, experimentally, through WeChat. That mode is unchanged:

```bash
npm run companion            # terminal chat
npm run companion -- --fake  # no model calls; replies labelled fake
```

The WeChat connection drives WeChat for Mac through macOS Accessibility. That isn't allowed by Tencent's terms and the account may be restricted, so use a test account, never your main one. Setup is in the [Chinese README](README.zh-CN.md) and the [operations guide](docs/guide.en.md).

The same WeChat setup can carry the agent instead of the companion: `npm run agent -- wechat` (`--draft` to show replies without sending). It answers in Mandarin as 小拜, with every tool the agent has: health, calendar, money, news and the wallet. A purchase request is written by code into the chat; a short yes (`好`, `可以`, `买吧`, `ok`) approves it and a short no (`算了`, `不要`) rejects it. Code matches the whole message against fixed lists, so the model can't approve anything; `/approve N` and `/reject N` work too. Only requests shown in that chat can be approved there; while `watch` runs, Telegram's buttons work too. `--draft` never approves anything. It shares the companion's lock, so only one of them answers the chat at a time.

### iMessage

`npm run agent -- imessage -m` answers in Mandarin as 小拜; `-e` (the default) answers in English as `DEARBYTE_PERSONA`. It uses the Mac's Messages app: it reads new texts from the Messages database and sends replies through AppleScript. It answers one person, set by `DEARBYTE_IMESSAGE_TO` or `--to`, and only in your one-to-one chat with them; texts already there when it starts are never answered. Approvals work as in WeChat: code writes the request, and a short "yes" or "no" (or 好 / 算了) answers it. `--draft` shows replies in the terminal and sends nothing.

Setup, once:

1. Sign in to Messages on this Mac. A separate Apple ID for DearByte works best. Your own also works: text yourself, and replies that come back to you are recognised as the agent's own and not answered.
2. Give your terminal app Full Disk Access (System Settings → Privacy & Security → Full Disk Access), then restart it. That's what lets it read the Messages database.
3. The first reply asks to let the terminal control Messages; allow it.

Photos aren't read yet; the agent is told one arrived.
